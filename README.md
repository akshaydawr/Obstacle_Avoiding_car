# Obstacle Avoiding Robotic Car System

## Overview

This project involves a robotic car system designed to prevent accidents by detecting obstacles and automatically stopping the car.

## Key Features

- **Obstacle Detection**: Sensors detect obstacles in the car's path.
- **Automatic Stopping**: The car stops when an obstacle is detected to avoid collisions.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instantaneous decision-making to ensure safety.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites**: Hardware (robotic car, sensors) and software (control algorithms).
2. **Connect Sensors**: Install and connect obstacle detection sensors.
3. **Program Car**: Upload the control software to the robotic car's system.
4. **Test**: Run the system to ensure proper obstacle detection and stopping functionality
